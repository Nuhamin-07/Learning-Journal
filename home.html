            <h3>How I stay committed to learning</h3>
            <p>
                I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner. I used to spend hours and hours learning, then try to create simple projects using what I learned or work new techniques into existing projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                While that was fun, I felt like it would be helpful to share what I was learning and most things about my journey with the world.

            <h3>How Scrimba Helped Me Learn by Doing</h3>
            <p>
                While I was feeling stuck in endless tutorial hell, I came across the Scrimba Frontend Career Path: an interactive and user-friendly learning experience that finally made things click for me. Unlike passive video tutorials, Scrimba encouraged hands-on practice, which helped me build true muscle memory by coding things myself. This shift from watching to doing transformed my learning process and gave me the confidence to apply what I learned in real-world projects.
